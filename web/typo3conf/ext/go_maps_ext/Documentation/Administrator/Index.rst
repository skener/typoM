Administrator Manual
====================

- All optional fields can be hide from non admins.

- Required fields are listed in the section “Users manual”.

- You can configure via TypoScript how to open and close an InfoWindow
  for all addresses and where the addresses are stored

- With jQuery you can configure the map, the coordinates and the bounds
  by JavaScript after initialization. An example script to display a
  polyline between all markers you'll find in the extension folder
  (/Resources/Public/Scripts/jquery-polyline-example.js).
