Development Environment
=======================

To simplify the development for TYPO3 and solr related components we provide a development environment based on vagrant and the Homestead box of the TYPO3 core.

You can find the development box in the following git repository:

https://github.com/TYPO3-Solr/solr-typo3-devbox

When you start the box, you will find a pre-configured environment for the support TYPO3 LTS version and the solr installation that is needed for the installed EXT:solr version.
